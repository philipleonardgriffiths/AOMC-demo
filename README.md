# ONUG Agentic AI Overlay — Security Demo

**AI Networking Summit 2026 — ONUG Agentic AI Overlay Working Group**

## What is this?

A hands-on demonstration that shows what happens when a rogue AI agent attacks an enterprise — and what it takes to stop it.

Enterprises are deploying autonomous AI agents that make API calls, access databases, invoke tools, and communicate with other agents — all at machine speed, without human oversight. **No existing security standard governs this.** Traditional controls (firewalls, IAM, MFA) were designed for humans, not autonomous software agents operating across trust boundaries.

This demo makes the risk concrete:

- **Scenario 1: The Catastrophic Cascade** — A rogue agent exploits six missing security controls. In under two minutes: 100,000 cardholder records exfiltrated, firewall rules destroyed, sessions hijacked, audit logs wiped. Estimated damage: **$500M+**.
- **Scenario 2: The Layered Defense** — The same attack, same rogue agent. Now six AOMC controls are active. Every attack phase is detected, blocked, and audited. Zero damage.

## NetFoundry submission

NetFoundry has prepared a Scenario 2 submission that demonstrates how identity-first, default-deny connectivity can be used to secure agentic AI systems.

The core idea is simple: agents, tools, APIs, services, and gateways should not be reachable merely because they are on the network. NetFoundry/OpenZiti applies **authorize-before-connect** access, making reachability identity-bound, policy-controlled, observable, and revocable at the service/session level.

This turns Scenario 2 from a layered defense demo into a practical model for reducing both agentic AI risk and the operational “connectivity tax” created by firewall, VPN, NAT, routing, and security-group changes.

## Why should I care?

AI agents are already being exploited in production. The AI Incident Database catalogs 900+ incidents and growing — training data exfiltration, prompt injection across trust boundaries, autonomous trading losses in the nine figures, and backdoors injected via AI coding assistants.

The six controls demonstrated here are the result of the ONUG Agentic AI Overlay Working Group — enterprises including eBay, Cigna, Bank of America, Indeed, and Kraken — defining what's mandatory to secure multi-agent systems. These map directly to [NIST SP 800-53 AI Overlays](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final) and the CSA [MAESTRO](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/) framework.

| # | Control | What It Prevents |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Agent Identity & Attestation** | Rogue agents spoofing trusted identities |
| 2 | **Runtime Monitoring** | Machine-speed reconnaissance going undetected |
| 3 | **Data Guardrails** | PII/PCI exfiltration without DLP inspection |
| 4 | **Zero-Trust Enforcement** | Lateral movement across trust domain boundaries |
| 5 | **Tool Authorization** | Unauthorized execution of high-privilege tools |
| 6 | **Autonomy Governance** | Catastrophic autonomous actions without human approval |

## Architecture Reference

The demo visualizes the ONUG reference architecture:

- **Three trust domains**: Private DC, Cloud VPC, External/Partner
- **Agent nodes** with blue (trusted) or magenta (untrusted) outlines
- **Rogue agent** with pulsing red glow and skull icon
- **Connection types**: Blue (A2A), Yellow (agent-to-data), Red (malicious), Green (blocked)
- **AOMC overlay** (orange) wraps the topology when controls are active

## ONUG Working Group Papers

The demos are based on two papers produced by the ONUG Agentic AI Overlay Working Group: *Part A: Agentic AI Overlay Architecture* and *Part B: Scaling, Deployment, and Operationalization Strategies*. The full content is organized topically in `docs/`:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Reference Architecture](docs/aomc-reference-architecture.md) | Overlay architecture, trust domains, AOMC ten-point reference, component descriptions, operational flows |
| [Enterprise Requirements](docs/enterprise-requirements.md) | The six controls with poll data, MAESTRO mappings, and single- vs. multi-domain requirements |
| [Scaling & Deployment](docs/scaling-and-deployment.md) | Key observations, strategic recommendations, operational targets, deployment patterns |
| [Use Cases](docs/use-cases.md) | Initial use cases and top 10 from community poll |
| [Security Standards](docs/security-standards.md) | NIST SP 800-53 AI Control Overlays, MAESTRO seven-layer mapping, integration guidance |

## Vendor Customization

Security vendors can fork this repo and inject their product names, logos, and branding into Scenario 2. When your control blocks an attack phase, the audience sees **"Protected by YourProduct"** on the blocked overlay — your product takes credit for each mitigation.

Vendor demos can be used for **TTT (Train-the-Trainer) sessions** at the AI Networking Summit and submitted for an **Agentic AI Overlay Award**.

See the **[Vendor Integration Guide](docs/vendor-guide.md)** for full setup instructions covering both demos.
